- **Deprecated:** :g:`Cyclic.ZModulo.ZModulo` because there have been no known
  use cases for this module and because it does not implement `Z/nZ` for
  arbitrary `n` as one might expect based on the name. The same construction
  will remain a part of the Coq test suite to ensure consistency of
  `CyclicAxioms`
  (`#16914 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16914>`_,
  by Andres Erbsen).
