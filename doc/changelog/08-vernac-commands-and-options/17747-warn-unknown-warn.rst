- **Changed:**
  :opt:`Warnings` and :attr:`warnings` now emit a warning when trying to enable an unknown warning
  (there is still no warning when disabling an unknown warning as this behavior is useful for compatibility)
  (`#17747 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/17747>`_,
  by GaÃ«tan Gilbert).
