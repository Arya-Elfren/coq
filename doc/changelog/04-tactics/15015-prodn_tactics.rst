- **Changed:**
  Documentation in the tactics chapter to give the current correct syntax,
  consolidate tactic variants for each tactic into a single,
  unified description for each tactic and many wording improvements.
  With this change, following similar changes to other chapters
  in previous releases, the correctness of documented syntax is
  assured by semi-automated tooling in all chapters except SSReflect
  (`#15015 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/15015>`_,
  `#16498 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16498>`_, and
  `#16659 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16659>`_,
  by Jim Fehrle, reviewed by Th√©o Zimmermann).
